# Hospital Management System (HMS)

## Overview
The **Hospital Management System (HMS)** is designed to streamline and optimize hospital operations by integrating various administrative and clinical processes. This system supports multi-departmental workflows, ensuring the seamless exchange of information while improving the quality of patient care. With modules ranging from patient registration to billing, HMS offers an all-in-one solution for hospitals and healthcare providers.
